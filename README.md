# nasa space apps 2018 

This is the source code for our project 'Launch Mapper' as part of NASA Space Apps 2018. Here our task was to come up with a product that was based on the theme of Space and Earth.
We chose to do our project on rocket launches - here our product would help to show users where they can plan a trip to specific rocket launches. They can plan their experience around the latest rocket launches, where they were happening, give them a list of hotels to stay at and flights they can catch to the site. There will also be plans for a VR element to be added to the product for users who are unable to see the rocket launches in person.
